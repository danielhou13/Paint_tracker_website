## Paint Tracker Website combined repo
While developing, I was working on one git repo to coordinate changes to the Django backend and the react frontend.
More details about the frontend and backend can be found in their respective repository. Alternatively, you can navigate into the
folders above and use the Readme.md in the respective folders.
